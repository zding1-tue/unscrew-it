# unscrew-it

Overview
Unscrew It! is a color-based puzzle game. 
The goal of the game is to clear all screws from the boards while managing the buffer and target slots strategically.

How to Run the Game
Steps
1. Extract the ZIP file.
2. Open the unscrew-it folder in VSC.
3. Run the game by executing the Main.java file.

Basic Rules
1. There are some boards, each containing some screws.
2. You can only click screws that are less than 50% covered.
3. When a screw’s color matches one of the target slots, it fills that slot.
4. If not, it goes into the buffer (max 4 slots). If the buffer overflows → Game Over.
5. When a target slot fills with three screws of the same color, it clears automatically and refreshes with a new color.
6. The game is won when all screws are cleared and the buffer is empty.
